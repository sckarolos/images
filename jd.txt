Step-by-Step Explanation
Parameters:

monthlyContribution: The fixed amount contributed each month.
investmentGrowthRate: The annual growth rate of the investment (e.g., a percentage like 0.05 for 5%).
inflation_Rate: The annual inflation rate (e.g., 0.02 for 2%).
yearsToRetirement: The number of years until retirement.
Calculate the Monthly Growth Rate:

monthlyRate = Math.pow(1 + investmentGrowthRate, 1 / 12);
This converts the annual investment growth rate to a monthly growth rate using the formula 
(1+ùëü)^1/12
, where 
ùëü
r is the annual growth rate.
rate = monthlyRate - 1;
rate is then set to the monthly growth rate in decimal form, which will be applied in the monthly compounding process.
Initialize Tracking Variables:

year = 0; ‚Äî Tracks the current year, used to adjust for inflation.
compoundedAmount = 0; ‚Äî Holds the accumulated value, which grows each month with the monthly contributions and investment returns.
Monthly Compounding Loop:

The for loop iterates over each month until retirement (yearsToRetirement * 12 months).
Inside the loop:
First Month Calculation:
If i === 0 (first month), compoundedAmount is initialized by adding the monthly contribution plus the return on that contribution (rate * monthlyContribution).
Subsequent Months:
Every 12 months (when (i + 1) % 12 === 1), year is incremented to reflect the passing of a full year.
newAm calculates the new contribution value adjusted for inflation: monthlyContribution * Math.pow(1 + inflation_Rate, year).
compoundedAmount is updated by adding the adjusted newAm contribution and compounding it with the monthly growth rate (newAm * rate).
Return the Compounded Amount:

After iterating over all months, compoundedAmount reflects the future value of the contributions, adjusted for monthly compounding and inflation, and is returned.
Summary
This function calculates the projected future value of monthly contributions, compounded monthly with a specified investment growth rate. It also adjusts each monthly contribution for inflation based on the year. The result, compoundedAmount, represents the total savings at retirement, accounting for investment growth and inflation.

This method is suitable for simulating the effect of inflation and compounding interest on regular contributions over a specified period.
