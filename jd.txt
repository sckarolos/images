🧩 What is RAG (in this context)?

RAG makes your LLM “design-system aware.” Instead of asking a model to generate Angular code blindly, you feed it your component library + docs + Storybook stories so it can ground answers in your actual system.

Without RAG:

User: “Make a primary button” → LLM might hallucinate <blue-button>

With RAG:

User: “Make a primary button” → RAG fetches your MyButton docs from Storybook and the LLM outputs:

<my-button variant="primary">Click Me</my-button>

⚙️ RAG Pipeline for an Angular Design System
1. Collect Knowledge

Gather sources of truth:

Component code: .ts and .html in libs/design-system/

Storybook stories: Button.stories.ts → usage examples

Documentation: README, MDX files, API docs (if any)

2. Embed Knowledge

Use an embedding model (e.g. OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, or open-source like sentence-transformers).

Split long files into chunks (e.g. per component, per story).

Store them in a vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, or even SQLite with pgvector).

Example record in DB:

{
  "id": "my-button-docs",
  "content": "MyButton: Props { variant: primary|secondary, disabled: boolean } Example: <my-button variant='primary'>Click</my-button>",
  "metadata": { "component": "MyButton" }
}

3. Query + Retrieve

When the user says:

"Give me a form with a primary button and a text input"

Steps:

Convert query → embedding.

Vector DB retrieves most relevant chunks (e.g. docs for MyButton, MyInput).

Send these docs + the user prompt to the LLM.

4. LLM Generation (Grounded in RAG)

The LLM gets a prompt like:

You are an assistant generating Angular templates using this design system. 
Only use the components provided below:

--- COMPONENT DOCS ---
<MyButton> props: variant, disabled
<MyInput> props: label, type
--- END DOCS ---

User request: A form with a text input for email and a primary button.


Expected output:

<form>
  <my-input label="Email" type="email"></my-input>
  <my-button variant="primary">Submit</my-button>
</form>

5. Validation Layer

Parse output.

Ensure only known components are used.

Auto-fix simple mismatches (e.g., “color=primary” → variant="primary").

6. Preview in Angular + Storybook

Render result in a preview pane using Angular’s ComponentFactoryResolver or dynamic Storybook rendering.

Let users tweak code live (Monaco Editor).

🔧 Tools You’ll Likely Use

Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small / text-embedding-3-large, or OSS like all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Vector DB: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, or Supabase pgvector.

LLM: GPT-4.1 / Claude 3.5 for prototyping, later LLaMA/Mistral fine-tuned.

Glue Code:

Node.js/NestJS backend to handle embedding + retrieval.

Angular frontend to send queries, render preview.

🚀 MVP Workflow

Index your storybook folder (stories + components).

Build a small NestJS API:

/query endpoint → does RAG retrieval + LLM call.

In Angular app:

Add a chat UI (user prompt).

Show preview of LLM output as Angular code.

👉 With this setup, your LLM won’t hallucinate new components — it’ll only generate UI with the building blocks you’ve already defined in your design system.
