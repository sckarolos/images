Successes – Key Outcomes

Nebula Design System Stability & Modernization: Delivered stability for the Nebula Design System and migrated it to GitHub using new workflows, making it the first Vanguard project exporting npm packages to Artifactory via the NX workflow.

Component Design & Standards: Designed and led the creation of new widget and card components used across multiple codebases. Established standards and best practices for new component development, improving consistency and scalability.

Onboarding & Mentorship: Interviewed and successfully onboarded new joiners, ensuring they quickly ramped up on technologies, tools, and workflows. Provided ongoing mentorship to accelerate their contribution to the team.

Collaboration with Designers: Partnered closely with design teams to assess and refine all Nebula components, ensuring technical feasibility and alignment with design expectations.

Codebase Refactoring & Quality Improvements: Led refactoring initiatives, performed comprehensive code reviews, and executed multiple cleanups across the Nebula codebase, improving maintainability and long-term scalability.

Community Building & Stakeholder Engagement: Strengthened the Design System community by organizing and running office hours, hosting regular meetings with Nebula champions and designers, and maintaining strong communication with UKPI and FAS stakeholders.

Opportunities / Missed

Accessibility Prioritization: While the team addressed and continues to fix accessibility issues, we have not yet quantified the percentage of outstanding issues. A stronger prioritization approach, in partnership with other teams and their product owners/delivery leads, would help target the most impactful improvements.

Cross-Project Technical Leadership: As tech lead, I see more opportunities to contribute to and shape the design of projects beyond Nebula within FAS and UKPI. Establishing standards at a higher organizational level could create broader alignment and consistency.

Look Ahead – Areas of Focus

Strategic Growth of Nebula: With Nebula now stable, I want to shape its future direction by exploring AI-driven solutions and automation that can accelerate development and design workflows. This aligns with Vanguard’s focus on efficiency, innovation, and scaling technology responsibly.

Expanding Beyond Web: Explore how Nebula can evolve to support mobile development, ensuring Vanguard delivers consistent and unified experiences across platforms and client touchpoints.

Championing Accessibility & Inclusion: Build on our progress by creating measurable accessibility benchmarks and partnering with cross-functional teams to make accessibility a proactive design standard, not just a compliance task.

Broader Influence Across FAS and UKPI: Extend my role as a tech lead to shape practices across other projects, helping to set Vanguard-wide component and workflow standards that improve consistency, reduce duplication, and strengthen our technology ecosystem.
