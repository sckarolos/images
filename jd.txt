I wanted to share a brief update on the progress we've made on the Nebula Design System, what’s currently in motion, and what’s ahead for Q3 2025.

✅ Recent Highlights

Governance Model Rolled Out:
We presented the new governance framework to all UKPI and FAS developers. Code changes are now centrally reviewed and prioritised. Marcos and I, together with the design team, review all new component requests against reusability, usage data, and customisation needs.

Backlog & Component Focus:
Based on usage data analysis, we’ve created an extended backlog and prioritised fixing and enhancing the most essential, reusable components – our “building blocks.”

New Strategic Components:
Development is underway on two new, fully customisable components – Widget and Card – designed to meet the needs of both Advice Dashboard (FAS) and Onboarding (UKPI). These follow all agreed standards: accessibility, test coverage, naming conventions, and dynamic content support.

Tech Debt & Upgrades:

Angular, Node, Nx, and Storybook have been upgraded (now on Angular 15; targeting Angular 17 by end of Q3).

GitHub migration is nearly complete; only the AEM integration remains, currently in testing with the AEM team.

Accessibility Improvements:
We’ve reduced Nebula’s accessibility issues by 10–15%, with a goal to reach 45% by end of September and 90% by end of year. Collaboration with the Accessibility Guild is ongoing, and we’re actively training others across design, marketing, and content.
