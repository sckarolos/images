Your intake process for a design system is well-structured, covering key phases from design to final integration. However, there are a few suggestions to streamline and clarify the process for improved alignment and efficiency.

Suggested Process Enhancements:
Clarify Component Definition and Requirements Early:

Step Name: Component Requirements and Definition
Rationale: Before designing, it helps to establish the purpose, requirements, and key states or variations of the component to align stakeholders. This prevents rework by ensuring everyone agrees on the component's scope and use cases from the start.
Combine Initial Review and Validation:

Step Name: Design Review and Validation
Rationale: Combining these two steps into a single “Design Review and Validation” stage can reduce duplication and speed up the process. Here, the council can review the component design while also validating if it meets the design system’s criteria.
Refine Development Steps:

Place Development directly after Testing to avoid confusion, as the component will likely need development resources right after the initial design and validation, and not after a secondary review.
Consolidate and Sequence Testing and Secondary Review:

Step Name: Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)
Rationale: If feasible, conduct testing (including functionality, accessibility, and visual checks) alongside a secondary review to save time. This allows both designers and developers to catch any issues or mismatches together before full integration.
Reconsider Normalization Timing:

Step Name: Pre-Launch Normalization
Rationale: Normalization should ideally occur just before launching or publishing the component in the design system. Moving this step after development but before the final integration or publishing ensures that the component adheres to standards at the end of the pipeline.
Formalize Integration and Feedback Loop:

Step Name: Integration & Feedback
Rationale: After documentation and normalization, create a feedback loop where initial users (e.g., other designers, developers) provide final insights or bug reports on the component in a real context. This step enables continuous improvement and catches any edge cases.
Suggested Revised Process:
Here’s a revised sequence that incorporates the above suggestions:

Component Requirements and Definition
Design
Design Review and Validation
Development
Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)
Documentation
Pre-Launch Normalization
Integration & Feedback
This refined process maintains the stages in your initial outline while promoting clarity and reducing redundancy.



Defining the purpose, value, and requirements of a component is essential for aligning stakeholders and ensuring consistency in design and development. Here are recommended formats and locations for capturing these details effectively:

1. Component Brief Document
Format: This document serves as a high-level summary, outlining the component’s purpose, value, requirements, and usage guidelines. It typically includes:
Component Purpose: Describe why the component is needed, its role in the design system, and the specific problem it addresses.
Core Value Proposition: Define the benefit it provides, such as improving user experience, enhancing accessibility, or simplifying development workflows.
Primary Use Cases and Examples: Outline typical scenarios for using this component, including any key states (e.g., active, disabled, loading).
Functional Requirements: List any functional needs (e.g., responsiveness, state changes).
Non-Functional Requirements: Include considerations like accessibility, performance, and compatibility.
Where to Define: Store in a collaborative tool (like Confluence, Notion, or Google Docs) where stakeholders can easily review, comment, and reference. Link this document to the design and development tools used by the team.
2. Component Specification Template (within the Design Tool)
Format: This template is embedded directly within your design tool (e.g., Figma, Sketch) and provides specific design details, ensuring everything needed for the component’s visual and functional design is immediately accessible to designers and developers. Include:
Component Overview: A brief description of its purpose and value.
Visual Variants: Document states like hover, focus, disabled, etc.
Anatomy and Layout: Define and label the parts (e.g., icon, text, button) with measurements and spacing guidelines.
Where to Define: Within each component’s file in the design tool, accessible to both designers and developers.
3. Design System Repository or Documentation Site
Format: A more formal and polished version of the purpose and guidelines, tailored for broader consumption across teams. This documentation typically includes:
Purpose and Rationale: A concise explanation of why the component exists.
Usage Guidelines: Clear instructions on when and how to use the component, along with do’s and don’ts.
Component States and Interactions: Details on the component’s behavior in different states (e.g., active, disabled, focus).
Accessibility Requirements: Notes on any accessibility considerations, like screen reader behavior.
Where to Define: In your design system documentation site (e.g., Storybook, Zeroheight, or custom design system website) where all team members can access it easily.
By using these structured formats and locations, the purpose, value, and usage of each component are transparent, reducing ambiguity and rework while ensuring consistent and effective integration across the design and development processes.



A Component Brief Document is a foundational document used to outline the purpose, requirements, and value of a new or updated component within a design system. This document helps align stakeholders early on, ensuring that the design, development, and usage of the component meet consistent expectations and solve specific problems for users. Here’s a breakdown of the key sections, with details on what each should include:

1. Overview
Purpose Statement: Briefly explain the component’s main purpose. This should answer “why” the component is being created and describe the specific problem it will solve.
Value Proposition: Summarize how the component adds value to the design system. Examples of value propositions include increasing user consistency, improving accessibility, enhancing developer efficiency, or ensuring UI consistency.
Stakeholders: List the key stakeholders who should review and approve the component, such as product managers, lead designers, developers, and accessibility experts.
2. Component Description
Brief Description: Describe the component’s appearance and primary function, such as “A modal that provides additional information without navigating away from the current screen.”
Core Functionality: Outline what the component should be able to do, e.g., "Display information in an overlay," "Close on click outside," "Support multiple sizes."
Intended User Experience (UX): Summarize how the component should behave from a user perspective, including any animations, state changes, or visual feedback.
3. Primary Use Cases
Use Cases and Contexts: List the main scenarios where this component will be used, such as in forms, navigation, modals, or within specific UI flows. Each use case should ideally describe the context (e.g., “used as a call-to-action within a form”).
Examples of Usage: Provide visual sketches or mockups if possible, demonstrating correct usage within common scenarios.
Do’s and Don’ts: Brief guidelines for usage and limitations (e.g., “Do use as a primary action in forms,” “Don’t use for secondary actions or inline text”).
4. Requirements
Functional Requirements: Define specific requirements that the component must meet. These could include:
Behavior: Expected behaviors, such as responsiveness to screen sizes, hover states, or actions like expanding/collapsing.
Interactivity: User actions like clicks, taps, drags, or keypresses, and expected results (e.g., “Clicking the ‘X’ button should close the modal”).
Non-Functional Requirements:
Accessibility: Requirements for accessibility, such as ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, focus management, color contrast, and screen reader support.
Performance: Any performance expectations, such as load time limits or restrictions on heavy assets.
Responsiveness: How the component should behave across various screen sizes and devices.
5. Design Specifications
Key Visual Attributes: Document color, typography, spacing, and alignment details, if already determined, or list guidelines for what these should include.
Component States: List and describe all component states (e.g., default, hover, active, disabled, loading). Each state should include details on behavior and visual changes.
Variants and Customizations: Describe any variations (e.g., primary vs. secondary button) or customization options (e.g., different icon options, sizes, or colors).
6. Dependencies and Interactions
Other Component Dependencies: Mention if this component relies on or interacts with other components within the system (e.g., a dropdown menu that relies on button functionality).
System Interactions: Describe how the component is expected to work with other parts of the application or design system, particularly in complex flows.
7. Acceptance Criteria
Define the specific criteria that must be met for the component to be approved. Acceptance criteria help set clear, measurable standards for successful completion. Examples include:
Design Accuracy: Matches the approved mockup designs and follows brand guidelines.
Functional Testing: Passes functional tests for each use case.
Accessibility Testing: Meets all defined accessibility requirements.
Cross-Browser and Cross-Device Compatibility: Functions consistently across supported browsers and devices.
8. Review and Approval Process
Approval Workflow: Outline who needs to sign off on each stage of the component lifecycle (design, development, testing, etc.).
Feedback Process: Define how feedback should be collected and incorporated, and the expected timelines for review. Include contact points for additional queries.
9. Timeline and Next Steps
Timeline: Provide an estimated timeline for each phase of the component’s creation (design, development, testing, and final review).
Next Steps: Outline immediate next steps or action items, including any remaining tasks before moving into the design or development phase.
Where to Store the Component Brief Document
A collaborative, accessible platform is ideal for storing component briefs. Common options include:

Design and Project Management Tools: Notion, Confluence, or Google Docs can be good for storing and versioning these documents.
Linked to Design System Documentation: If using a system like Storybook or Zeroheight, include a link to the brief for easy reference alongside the component.
