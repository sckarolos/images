Server-Side Rendering (SSR) cache in an Angular app improves performance by storing the rendered HTML responses of certain pages on the server, so they can be quickly returned to subsequent users without needing to re-render the page from scratch every time. This caching mechanism reduces server load and speeds up page load times, especially for static or less frequently changing pages.

Here's how SSR caching works in an Angular app and how to implement it effectively:

1. Basic SSR Workflow
In a typical Angular Universal (SSR) setup:

The user requests a page.
The server renders the Angular app on the server, generates the HTML, and sends it back to the client.
The client-side Angular app then takes over (hydration) to handle further interactions.
Without caching, the server renders the Angular app on every request, which can be expensive for performance, especially with complex pages or heavy traffic.

2. How SSR Cache Works
To avoid re-rendering the Angular app on every request, SSR caching stores the generated HTML for a specific page so it can be reused. The next time the same page is requested:

Instead of rendering the app again, the server returns the cached HTML.
This drastically reduces the time and computational resources required to serve the page.
3. Types of SSR Caching
There are a few common caching strategies used in SSR, depending on how dynamic the content is:

1. Full Page Cache
The entire HTML page is cached after the first request.
All users receive the same cached page for a specific route until the cache is invalidated or expires.
2. Route-Based Cache
You cache the HTML output based on the requested route.
For example, /about and /contact might each have their own cached version, allowing route-specific caching.
3. Dynamic Cache with Content-Based Invalidation
You can cache pages for users or for specific content, but invalidate the cache when the underlying content changes (e.g., when fetching dynamic data from an API).
This is useful for pages that have content that changes frequently.
4. Setting Up SSR Cache in Angular with Express
Since Angular Universal uses Express.js to handle the SSR process, you can configure caching within your Express server logic (typically in app.server.ts).

Here’s a step-by-step process to add SSR caching:

1. Install express-cache Middleware
Install a caching middleware to enable easy caching of routes.

bash
Αντιγραφή κώδικα
npm install apicache --save
2. Configure Cache in app.server.ts
In your app.server.ts, integrate caching logic using the apicache middleware. This middleware can cache responses and store them for a defined duration.

Example app.server.ts:
typescript
Αντιγραφή κώδικα
import 'zone.js/dist/zone-node';
import { ngExpressEngine } from '@nguniversal/express-engine';
import * as express from 'express';
import { join } from 'path';
import { AppServerModule } from './src/main.server';
import { APP_BASE_HREF } from '@angular/common';
import { existsSync } from 'fs';
import * as apicache from 'apicache'; // Cache middleware

const cache = apicache.middleware; // Initialize apicache middleware

export function app(): express.Express {
  const server = express();
  const distFolder = join(process.cwd(), 'dist/browser');
  const indexHtml = existsSync(join(distFolder, 'index.original.html')) ? 'index.original.html' : 'index';

  // Use Angular Express engine to render server-side
  server.engine('html', ngExpressEngine({
    bootstrap: AppServerModule,
  }));

  server.set('view engine', 'html');
  server.set('views', distFolder);

  // Cache certain routes for 10 minutes
  server.use(cache('10 minutes')); // Cache middleware to cache responses for 10 minutes

  // Route handling
  server.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res.render(indexHtml, { req, providers: [{ provide: APP_BASE_HREF, useValue: req.baseUrl }] });
  });

  return server;
}

function run(): void {
  const port = process.env.PORT || 4000;
  const server = app();
  server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Node Express server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
}

declare const __non_webpack_require__: NodeRequire;
const main = __non_webpack_require__.main;
if (main === module) {
  run();
}

export * from './src/main.server';
3. Explanation of the Caching Logic:
apicache middleware is integrated to cache server responses.
server.use(cache('10 minutes')) ensures that all requests are cached for 10 minutes. You can adjust the cache duration based on your needs.
The cache stores the rendered HTML of the page in memory and returns the cached HTML for subsequent requests within the cache duration.
5. Strategies for Cache Invalidation
There are several ways to manage cache invalidation (i.e., clearing the cache when the data changes):

1. Time-Based Expiration
Set an expiration time (like 10 minutes in the example above), after which the cache is automatically invalidated and re-rendered.

2. Content Change-Based Invalidation
You can integrate logic to clear or update the cache when specific content or data changes. For example:

If you're fetching dynamic data from an API, you could invalidate the cache when that API returns updated content.
Example with API-based invalidation:
typescript
Αντιγραφή κώδικα
server.get('/api/data', cache('5 minutes', (req, res) => res.statusCode === 200), (req, res) => {
  // Fetch data from API
});
3. Cache Bypass for Logged-In Users
For user-specific content, such as a user dashboard, you can bypass caching by checking if a user is logged in. For example:

typescript
Αντιγραφή κώδικα
server.get('/dashboard', (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user) {
    return next(); // Bypass cache for logged-in users
  }
  cache('10 minutes')(req, res, next);
}, (req, res) => {
  res.render('dashboard.html', { req });
});
6. Where to Store the Cache
There are various places where the SSR cache can be stored:

In-memory (default): The cache is stored in the server's memory, but it is lost when the server restarts.
Distributed cache (Redis or Memcached): For production systems with multiple server instances or high availability requirements, you may use an external cache like Redis to store the SSR cache. This ensures that the cache is available across multiple server instances and persists across restarts.
7. Benefits of SSR Cache
Faster Response Times: Cached pages are returned almost instantly, reducing time-to-first-byte (TTFB).
Reduced Server Load: Since the server does not need to re-render pages for every request, the computational load is reduced.
Improved SEO: Server-side rendering provides fully rendered HTML to crawlers (like Googlebot), but caching ensures the server can handle high traffic efficiently.
Better User Experience: Users get fast, fully-rendered pages on first load, enhancing the perceived performance of the app.
8. Challenges with SSR Cache
Dynamic Content: Pages that show user-specific content (e.g., a personalized dashboard) require careful cache management, as the cached page may not be suitable for all users.
Cache Invalidation: You need to implement intelligent cache invalidation strategies to ensure that users receive up-to-date content without overloading the server by constantly re-rendering pages.
Summary
SSR caching in Angular Universal improves performance by storing server-rendered HTML pages, which can be quickly served to users. This reduces the need to re-render the app on every request, lowering server load and speeding up responses. By integrating caching middleware like apicache into your Express server, you can easily manage caching strategies, with options for time-based expiration, content-based invalidation, and user-specific cache bypassing.
